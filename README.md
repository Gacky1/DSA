# 🚀 DSA C++ Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA C++ Practice Repository**! This repository contains my solutions and practice implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **C++**. The purpose of this repo is to document my learning journey and help others who are also preparing for **coding interviews, competitive programming,** or improving their **problem-solving skills**.

---

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository includes:

- Implementations of fundamental **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- Solutions to **Leetcode, Codeforces, CodeChef, and GFG** problems.
- **Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, etc.
- **Well-structured and optimized code** with explanations.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the programs locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- **Any Code Editor** (VS Code, Sublime, CodeBlocks, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-cpp-practice.git
cd dsa-cpp-practice
```

### Compile and run any C++ program:
